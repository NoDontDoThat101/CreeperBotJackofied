# The perfect bot to annoy your friends!
Are you tired of having a good relationship in your Minecraft discord server? 

Do you want to be constantly annoyed by the threat of an 'aw man'?  

Do you want to start an internal torment between every server member because it's funny?

Do you want chaos to erupt to see who can get the highest amount of useless intrenet points?

**This is the bot for you!**  
# Features:
- Statistics
    - Counts the amount of time a user has said creeper
    - Bullys them if they say it too much
    - Users can see how many times they have said it by typing "!stats"
    - Users will see stats on a per server basis (ie: If said 20 times on one guild and 40 on another users will only see the 20 or 40) 
    - You can reset your or evenyone's stats with !stats reset

- Restraint
    - The bot will not do anything if the channel name contains the word "vent"
    - The bot will also not reply to itself causing an infinite loop of messages

- Editable status messages
    - The bot will randomly choose a status from the list in messages.py
    - Statuses are deitable and sorted by "games" and "playing"

- Cyberbullying
    - The bot automatically gives any user that says creeper a role that anyone can mention
    - Cyberbullying is encoraged through use of that role

- Testing Mode
    - Want to test your own code? Just add a testing.txt to the folder and use a test token instead of a production!

- Backups
    - The bot takes daily backups of stats into a dedicated channel if the settings are set
